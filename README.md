# SimpleGameJava
A Java implementation of Andy Harris's SimpleGame.js using JavaFX. Read more about the original SimpleGame.js at (http://aharrisbooks.net/h5g/documentation.html) with its source code at (http://aharrisbooks.net/h5g/h5g_5/simpleGame.js)


The files for the game engine itself are located in the 'SimpleGame' directory.

A few basic demos of functionality of the engine are in the 'demos' directory. NOTE: these demos were created before the engine was completely finished, but all of the functionality in their Game.java files is useable in the current iteration of the game engine.
TL;DR: for the demos, just look at the Game.java files. Don't read the other files as they might be slightly different.
